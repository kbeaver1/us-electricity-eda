```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(readxl)
```

## R Markdown

Great resource for dataset: <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesale/>

```{r Dataset}
electricity_dataset <- read_excel("electricity-2024.xlsx")
electricity_dataset
```

```{r}
data_2014 <- read_excel ("./Data/ice_electric-2014final.xls")
data_2014
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
